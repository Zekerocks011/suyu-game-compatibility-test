  "description": "WHAT'S NEW?\n\nFree new content! Play Among Golf, a whole new single-player campaign inspired by a suspiciously familiar game we like a lot.\n\nWe also made the game ready for exciting monthly events - stay tuned!\n\nA silly physics-based golf parody where every golf course is a new surprising type of golf, some brilliant or hilarious, others so absurd you will ask yourself: WHAT THE GOLF?\n\nNOT A GOLF GAME!\nSure, it has ‘golf’ in the title but that’s about where the similarity to golf ends. WHAT THE GOLF? is at heart a comedy game with puzzles, challenges and loads of surprises. Okay, so there’s a bit of what you might recognise as golf in there but loads more of what definitely isn’t! Confused? Excellent!\n\n500 CREATIVE LEVELS\nTry Sporty Sports!, It’s Snowtime, A Hole New World or one of the hundreds of other incomprehensible levels, featuring toasters, hot dogs, office chairs and a multitude of utterly random objects.\n\nDAILY CHALLENGES\nCome back every day to play new courses and win a bunch of more or less useful prizes.\n\nJOIN THE COUCH PARTY… OF TWO\nGrab your clubs (string of sausages, frozen rubber glove, it doesn’t matter which) and tee off into a hilarious anarchic world. \n\nBUT I HATE GOLF\nTo be honest, so do we. And that’s the beauty of WHAT THE GOLF? A game made for people who hate golf, by people with no clues or respect for the game. Let’s play!",
