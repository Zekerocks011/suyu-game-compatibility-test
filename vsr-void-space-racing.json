  "description": "\"VSR: Void Space Racing is a one-of-kind racing game that finds itself very welcome in the Switch library. There is simply nothing quite like it; you're wrestling with raw physics as much as your rival racers, and the overall experience is brutal yet incredibly rewarding. Be prepared to swallow your pride in the first few sessions - during which you will be nothing short of a space pinball - and then aim for the stars.\"\n~ Nintendo Life, 8/10\n\nCompete for the highscore online. Unlock new colourful stages by completing single mode races. Challenge a friend in local multiplayer. Drift in space like there's no tomorrow!\n\nMain features:\n- No friction\n- Online highscores\n- Split-screen local multiplayer\n- Unlockable spaceships and exciting stages \n- Challenging gameplay for racing connoisseurs\n- Thrilling electronic soundtrack",
