  "description": "Dr. Rosalene and Dr. Watts have peculiar jobs: They give people another chance to live, all the way from the very beginning... but only in their patients' heads.\n\nDue to the severity of the operation, the new life becomes the last thing the patients remember before drawing their last breath. Thus, the operation is only done to people on their deathbeds, to fulfill what they wish they had done with their lives, but didn’t.\n\nThis particular story follows their attempt to fulfill the dream of an elderly man, Johnny. With each step back in time, a new fragment of Johnny's past is revealed. As the two doctors piece together the puzzled events that spanned a lifetime, they seek to find out just why the frail old man chose his dying wish to be what it is.\n\nAnd Johnny's last wish is, of course... to go to the moon.\n\nKEY FEATURES\n•\tA unique & non-combat story-driven experience\n•\tInnovative mix between adventure game elements and classic RPG aesthetics\n•\tAcclaimed original soundtrack that closely ties to the story\n•\tAn espresso execution with zero filler and no time drains",
