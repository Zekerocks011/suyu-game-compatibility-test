  "description": "Mitsuki moves from the country to Tokyo to attend a rigorous cram school, with the hopes of passing his university entrance exams next spring. He soon finds, however, that his other classmates treat him like a social outcast, being the oldest at his school by far. It proves impossible to make friends, and Mitsuki consigns himself to an isolated, lonely existence...\n\nThat is, until he meets the single mother, Himuro Kyouko, who just-so-happens to live in the same apartment complex as him. Mitsuki offers to help Kyouko babysit her daughter, Tama. Kyouko, in turn, helps Mitsuki study for his upcoming exams. Over the course of a year, the two bond — first, as friends, and then as something more.\n\nFeatures:\n* Around 80,000 word kinetic story (approx 5-6 hours of reading)\n* Detailed background and character art\n* A custom OST\n* Daily messages from Kyouko, the story’s heroine\n* A cute single mother!",
