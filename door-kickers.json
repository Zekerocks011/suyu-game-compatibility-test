It’s mine and if you cross it, I will protect it.” Anonymous Author\n\nBecome the commander of an elite anti-terrorist squad and lead them on the most dangerous missions. Remember you are the good guy, but sometimes it's better to pull the trigger and go home on your own than to be carried. Yours and your men’ssquad life are the most important.\n\nAnalyze the situation, plan team routes, choose equipment, breach points and coordinate multiple troopers to reach the hostage room before the bad guys get to press that trigger.\n\nIt may sound daunting and like real world CQB combat. But most levels can be completed in minutes and on the fly - improvisation works. Achieving the perfect planning, getting the mission done with no false steps, that’s a skill hard to master.\n\nFEATURES:\n- 2D, Top Down for optimal tactical analysis\n- Real-time with combat pause\n- No turns, no hexes, no action points or awkward interfaces\n- Realistic but action-packed\n- Non-linear levels\n- Unlimited gameplay via mission generator\n- Freeform tactics -  improvise, adapt, overcome\n- Prepare your squad, chose equipment and weapon\n- 5 trooper classes \n",
