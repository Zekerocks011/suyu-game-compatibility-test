  "description": "In SuperMash, players can blend together iconic genres to create never-before-seen gaming experiences! Jump through classic Platformer levels with a tactical Stealth character, fight as spaceships in engaging JRPG battles, and more! Anything is possible with SuperMash’s emergent system, which creates a unique game every time you play.\n\n●\tThe Possibilities Are Endless! – Pick two retro game genres and let SuperMash design the rest. Players can currently mash together Platformer, Action Adventure, Shoot ‘Em Up, Metrovania, Stealth, and JRPG for a wide variety of wacky results.\n\n●\tExpect the unexpected! – Glitches, goals, and obstacles change up the gameplay to make every jump and shot meaningful. Plus, with three difficulty modes, you can pick the challenge that’s right for you.\n\n●\tCustomize Your Games! – With Dev Cards, you can customize elements of each Mash, like enemies, players, mechanics, and environments. Keep playing to collect them all!\n\n●\tChallenge Your Friends – Share each Mash’s unique code with a friend or streamer to see if they can succeed where you failed—or impress them by completing their “impossible” Mashes!\n\nThat’s just the beginning of what SuperMash has to offer! Over time, we will be supporting the game with various content updates and DLC. Keep an eye out for new genres, characters, Dev Cards, and more in the future!\n",
