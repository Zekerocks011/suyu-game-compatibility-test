If so, many trials await you as you squrp your way to victory in the squishiest of escapades!\n\nThe mechanics are simple!\nAfter jumping, jump again to ink downwards on the enemies you encounter as you blip and squip along your merry way! Can you stop Skwit Skwot before it’s too late?\n\nSquidlit does everything it can to be as accurate to Game Boy hardware as possible, including:\n\nNo more than 10 8-pixel wide sprites in a line.\nNo more than 40 sprites at any time.\nFour sound channels that are shared between \"instruments\" of music and the sound effects.\nAll sounds were made on a real Game Boy system (using LSDJ).\n160 x 144 pixel resolution.\nAnd a whopping 4 shades of... “grellow”.",
