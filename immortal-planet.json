  "description": "On the icy surface of a forgotten planet stand ruined tombs where immortals sleep. While sleepless warriors roam the halls with their minds eroded by eternity, a lone Awakewalker emerges from cryosleep. With no memory of their past, it’s up to them to forge their future, discover the planet’s mysteries, and find a way out of this icy hell.\n\nSouls-like Progression\nRecover Experiences lost upon death and use them to upgrade your character. Customize your playstyle with dozens of items and spells.\n\nTight Level Design\nLevels are designed around single checkpoints from which you explore the area around it.
