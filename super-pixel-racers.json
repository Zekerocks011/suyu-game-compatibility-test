  "description": "The game lets you hop straight into the driverâ€™s seat, but advanced features let players customize their racing experience even further. Your winnings let you purchase new cars of individual driving quality and upgrade schemes, from a pixelated F500 to your very own 16-bit Lancer Evolution. As the game progresses, find out which car suits the different disciplines and yourself best. Some features to look forward to are:\n\nRally Cross:\nClassic race against up to 7 other drivers\n\nRally:\nReach checkpoints on a procedurally generated outdoor track\n\nLand Rush:\nBe in front of the pack when the time ends\n\nTakedown:\nDestroy the other cars\n\nHunt:\nChase the target down\n\nDrift Show:\nScore points by drifting\n\nThirteen Unique Racetracks:\nFrom desert dunes to the city streets. A host of unique pixel environments set the stage for some truly super pixel racing.\n\nHone your drifting, score some Nitro:\nThe more you drift, the quicker your nitro gauge fills up. Use it for an instant hit of speed; equally useful for dodging obstacles or slamming into opponents.\n\nVehicle Damage & Explosion Mechanics:\nIn-race collisions result in visible damage to your pixel racer. Once a car takes too many hits, it goes up in flames!",
