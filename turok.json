Turok has vowed to find the eight pieces of the Chronoscepter spread throughout the Lost Land and put an end to The Campaigner's evil plot...\n\nTo learn more you must enter the world of Turok\n\nCompletely 3-D Virtual World\nRun, jump, climb in any direction in a fully 3D world, with the ability to independently look and aim your weapons up, down, or sideways.\nIntelligent Enemies Programmed for Ferocity\nVariable aggression profiles make each enemy behave uniquely.\n14 Monstrous High-tech Weapons\nFrom the Grenade Launcher, Plasma Pulse Rifle and Alien Weapon, to the Quad Rocket Launcher and, the mother of all guns, the Atomic Fusion Cannon!\nAdvanced Interactive Backgrounds with Particle Technology\nCobwebs sway.
