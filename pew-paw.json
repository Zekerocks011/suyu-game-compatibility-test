  "description": "Luckily, you have a third teammate: an old machine gun that you can upgrade for more twin-stick shooting frenzy! You’ll need to search the infested city for items required to craft new parts for your weapon and improve its damage, precision, firing speed, ammo capacity...\n\nThe map is randomly generated each time you play, but always full of zombies with different abilities and equipment. Some shoot rockets, some try to intoxicate you, some place nasty mines on the ground...and then there are the final bosses as well, but we'd rather not spoil you that.\n \nAccuracy and speed are necessary to be victorious over these damned creatures. But you may be overwhelmed, and that’s why you should also look for new armor suits and upgrade them.\nLast but not least, your loyal dog will show you the direction to new ammo and HP boxes ready to pick-up.\n\nFriendly tip: do not mess with the gravestones in the cemetery if you don’t want to meet Death (literally).\n\nPew Paw Features:\n- Twin-stick top-down shooting action\n- 100+ items to craft new weapon parts\n- Several zombie types to defeat\n- Final bosses, get a reward for their heads!\n- Armored suits to find and upgrade\n- Randomly generated levels with secrets and bonuses",
