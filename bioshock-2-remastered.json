  "description": "See Rapture through the eyes of Subject Delta, a fearsome Big Daddy prototype on a life-or-death mission to rescue his missing Little Sister. Eight years have passed since the events of the first BioShock, and Rapture's denizens have rallied into a collectivist cult. Wield even more Plasmid types, face off against a host of new enemies, and venture beyond Rapture's art deco architecture to traverse the ocean floor, all while being hunted by a new generation of supremely powerful predators: Big Sisters.\n\nAlso includes:\n\n• Minerva's Den - Uncover the mysteries of Rapture Central Computing, where an omniscient machine called The Thinker has fallen into the wrong hands.\n\n• Protector Trials - Choose specialized loadouts and see how long you can keep your Little Sister safe from waves of frenzied attackers in these combat-centric gauntlets.",
