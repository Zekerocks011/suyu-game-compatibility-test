Long ago, many would have entered this planetarium, to gaze longingly into the stars, to soothe their sorrows, and to find a sense of peace. \nIn this place of healing, he met a lone girl; a run-down robotic guide who had waited thirty long years for a visitor to come. Her name was Yumemi. Her one wish was for someone to repair the broken projector.\nEndless rain...\nThe man's fleeting days with Yumemi reminded him of days long gone. As he worked tirelessly to fix that which was broken he wondered, what would he wish for when he finally gazed into those artificial stars? \nWhat fate lied before Yumemi?\n",
