  "description": "Tcheco in the Castle of Lucio is an 8-bit, 2D platformer. It’s a challenging, non stop action experience that incentivizes quick thinking, platforming precision and memorization. \nLike older 8-bit games, it’s a game that’s meant to be replayed over and over again until mastered.\nQuick reactions and timing are necessary for success in the game. Levels – which are in the form of rooms – are short and require you to quickly scan to find a way to get to the next room, which is either a doorway that requires a key found within that room or a black hole\nVisually and from an auditory standpoint, everything about the game is designed to look and feel like an old school 8-bit game. \n\nFEATURES:\n\n+2D platform game, perfect for classic Famicom™/NES™ game fans!\n+Graphics and sounds inspired by 8-bit aesthetics.\n+2 game modes, \"Classic\" and the brand new \"Try harder\".\n+65 rooms of progressive difficulty.\n+Easy to learn, simple gameplay.\n",
