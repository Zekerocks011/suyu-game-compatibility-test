  "description": "Match your kart racing skills against a rag-tag crew of rivals as you explore a mysterious island packed with ancient temples, dragon-infested castles, and post apocalyptic ice cream stands.  Unlock and upgrade moon buggies, monster trucks and more.  Collect and master over forty unique powerups in an epic race for the ultimate trophy.\n\nBeach Buggy Racing 2: Island Adventure is an action-packed, mayhem-filled kart racer with split screen competition and game rule customization.   Play any part of the game solo or with friends in split screenâ€”from the story-driven Adventure mode to multi-event Championships, adrenaline-pumping Races, skill-mastering Drift Attacks and more.\n\nReady to go deeper?  Craft your own custom game modes!  Set your favorite configurations of powerups, race rules, lap counts and more, then save your rule set and play with up to 4 local players.  Want a 10-lap Race with Bouncy Tires and Rocket Boost powerups?  You can do that.  How about a Drift Attack with permanent Police Chase that you can play with 4 friends?  No problemo.  Maybe you want to test your racing skills with no powerups at all.  That's fine too.  It's your game, your rules.\n\nEasy to pick up and play, yet challenging to master, Beach Buggy Racing 2: Island Adventure is a fast-paced driving action game that delivers explosive fun for all skill levels.",
