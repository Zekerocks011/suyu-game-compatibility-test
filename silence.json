There, not only are they protected from the deadly bombardment, but are also at the crossroads of a world between life and death: Silence. When Noahâ€™s sister gets lost in Silence, he is forced to venture into this idyllic yet threatening world to find her.\n\nSilence, however, bears its own scars of war and suffering.

And witness when the siblings discover that the only thing that can save them is their love for each other.\n\n-Elaborately designed 3D characters and opulent 2D backgrounds\n-Three playable characters\n-There will be exciting new characters, but also a reunion with old friends",
