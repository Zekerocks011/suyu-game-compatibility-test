  "description": "You are the pilot of a battle mech BE-A Walker (Biped Enhanced Assault Walker). Your mission is to defeat the hostile natives to protect the colony population. But annihilation of the native race is not the only way to stop the war. Choose your side and make the decision that suits you best: to be a human, a true son of Earth fighting for survival of your race and killing whoever stands in your way, or to be a humanist whoâ€™s trying to protect the poor natives, victims of the greedy invaders.\n\nControlling the mech is not an easy thing. Raise up one leg, move it to the left or to the right, and then take a step. Repeat it for the other one. This is how the Walker walks. Control every leg to smash the enemies or to avoid grenades and missiles. \n\nKey features:\n\n- Seamlessly generated world\n- The weirdest and most cruel walking simulator out there\n- Upgrade your mech and weapons to become more dangerous\n- Defeat the natives or lead them in their effort to protect their homeworld",
