  "description": "Explore an enthralling forest island, learn magical songs and interact with the local wildlife to solve environmental puzzles.\n\nToki Tori 2+’s ingenious game design requires just two moves: whistle and stomp. It's super accessible, yet it builds up to incredible complexity later on.\n\nThere’s a ton to do, too. After puzzle-solving your way to five Ancient Frogs and saving the island from a strange pollution, you can still find 100s of golden wings, snap dozens of creature pictures and go Achievement hunting.\n\nToki Tori 2+ is better than ever on Nintendo Switch, with lots of gameplay tweaks and even some new secrets and puzzle solutions. Plus, you can now create checkpoints wherever you like, allowing for easy experimentation.\n\n• A unique take on the Metroidvania formula\n• Follow the path, or stray off-road and tackle the expert puzzles\n• Whistle magical songs to rewind, fast-travel and more\n• Snap dozens of Tokidex creature pictures\n\nBetter than ever on Nintendo Switch:\n• Tweaked gameplay, new secrets and solutions\n• Buttery smooth graphics at 60 fps\n• Featuring in-game Achievements\n• HD Rumble support\n• Video capture support",
