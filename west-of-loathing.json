Explore a vast open world and encounter a colorful cast of characters, some of whom are good, many of whom are bad, and a few of whom are ugly.\n\nFeatures:\n\n• A sprawling open world, chock full of danger, quests, puzzles, and mysteries\n• Lush hand-drawn black and white graphics\n• Thousands of jokes, gags, and goofs\n• Crunchy turn-based combat (but only if you want it)\n• Liberal use of the Oxford comma\n• Over 50 hats\n• Disreputable saloons\n• Several gulches\n• A drunk horse",
