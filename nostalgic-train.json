  "description": "NOSTALGIC TRAIN is a mystical and melancholic first-person adventure/walking simulator set in the Japanese countryside, where you solve not only the mystery of the missing people of Natsugiri, but also that of \"yourself\". \nIt contains both a story mode, \"Two fluctuations at journey's end\", and a free mode, where you can explore the world of Natsugiri at your own pace. \nRelax and immerse yourself in a fantastical world full of tragic stories and beautiful nostalgic scenery, created by the Japanese indie game developer, Tatamibeya.\n\n*Recommended by the 22nd Japan Media Arts Screening Committee*\n\n【Story】 \nI was so dazzled that I could barely open my eyes.

And... what am I doing here? \n\nA nostalgic countryside. \nA station marked \"Natsugiri\". \nA single-track railroad. \nAs if stepping out of the purest of white light, I woke up here, my memories gone.\nI could not find anyone in this strange place...",
