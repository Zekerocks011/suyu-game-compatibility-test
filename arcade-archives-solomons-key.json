  "description": "'Solomon's Key' is an action game that was released from Tecmo in 1986.\nPlayers make full use of the 'magic' of the main character Dana to collect items in various stages and get the book called 'Solomon's key'.\nUnusual for a game in its time, an arcade and consumer version were both developed at the same time.\n\nThe \"Arcade Archives\" series has faithfully reproduced many classic Arcade masterpieces.\nPlayers can change various game settings such as game difficulty, and also reproduce the atmosphere of arcade display settings at that time. Players can also compete against each other from all over the world with their high scores.\nPlease enjoy the masterpiece that built a generation for video games.",
