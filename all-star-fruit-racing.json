Balance speed and skill as you battle nine other racers in a frantically fruity scrap for the podium and the all-important winner's prizes, unlocking new characters, championships and kart parts along the way!\n\nMaster all the modes!\nCalled yourself the champion of the champion? The journey has just begun! Create Custom Championships and select between three different difficulty settings and speeds to fine-tune your challenge, or dive into a range of different gametypes including Dragster races, Hill Climbs, Elimination races, Time Attacks and even modifier-filled modes that rewrite the rulebook!\n\nDominate the seasons!\nBurn rubber in 21 incredible courses spread across five stunning worlds: Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter and Special Islands.

Will you let loose a volley of different power-ups, or save all of your fruit power until your unique Mega-Juice move's ready to help you reach first place?\n\nTake on friends and family!\nDon't race alone! Share the All-Star Fruit Racing fun with everyone at home or on the move with two-, three- and four-player split-screen action!\n\nChallenge the whole world!\nRace against others from across the globe in eight-player online showdowns!\n\nCustomize your kart!\nUnlock new parts as you play to help you redesign, rebuild and recolour your dream ride.
