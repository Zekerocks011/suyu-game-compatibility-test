  "description": "Start your Journey to Dream Gallery\nIn this marvelous sunny world, fallen flower petals lie in profusion. The clear mountain creek gently bubbles. Red-crowned cranes leisurely stroll across the creek, casually pecking fish from the water. The gentle breeze rustles the edges of your clothing. And following the footsteps of the wind, a flower petal roams through the grand halls, and gently lands on your shoulder. By the fountain of dreams, you gaze into the fragments of memory, and begin to ponder.\n\nThe Romance of the Past\nAll souls suffer in love, from the righteous but carefree heroes, to the well-wined concubines in the imperial palaces. Let the fragments of memory take you time-traveling to the ancient past, where you will sort out your destiny.\n\nThe Wishes of the Developers\nDue to our appreciation for traditional Chinese culture, fashion, landscapes, and artistic conception, we intend to develop a relaxing game that captures the leisure and rurality embodied in ancient Chinese poet Tao Yuan Ming’s timeless lines: “Gathering chrysanthemum under the eastern fence, I gaze on the southern mountains with tranquillity.“ \nThrough the collection of narrative photos taken by our camera crew who traveled all around China, we wish to present to you the authentic beauty of traditional Chinese aesthetics.
