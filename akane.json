  "description": "Akane is a brutal arena arcade slasher based on one-hit-one-kill gameplay mechanics where you will:\n\nFace five types of opponents:\n\n● Yakuza Guy - a common mafia pawn;\n● Tank - this is the only villain that will require more than just one katana slash to die;\n● Shooter - a sharpshooter with cybernetic enhancements. Pro tip: they never miss;\n● Cyber Ninja - a warrior who abdicated his body to become a killing machine. His dash attacks are deadly and his defense seems impenetrable. Remember however that everybody has their weak point;\n● The Boss - Katsuro, your Nemesis who evolves, gets stronger and more dangerous according to the number of times he gets killed.\n\nComplete missions to unlock new guns and equipment:\n\n● Different pistols;\n● Katanas, each with their own unique unique abilities;\n● Cigarettes that change the aesthetics of your special skills;\n● Gadgets that grant small but significant improvements in combat;\n● Boots that change the dash and the way you move on the screen.\n\nMake a good use of your special Samurai Skills:\n\n● Dragon Slash - dash forward killing every enemy on your way;\n● Dragon Slayer - kill all enemies on the screen.",
