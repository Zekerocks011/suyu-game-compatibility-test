Do you support emerging science or follow the mystical path? Will you desensitize yourself to the violence you have to inflict or try to preserve your humanity?\n\nThe decision is yours. So are the consequences.\n\nFeatures: \n- The torture chamber: study your victims, find their weak spot, and use your extensive arsenal (or their loved ones) to break them\n- An occult underground: a town filled with mysticism built around Medieval artefacts, such as the Hand of Glory and Mandrake Root\n- A dark economy: a market in dead flesh with you as its main supplier\n- Synesthesia: your character's unique perceptive abilities make him a walking lie detector\n- Staying sane: as a professional torturer you'll need to constantly manage your sanity to survive",
