  "description": "NoReload Heroes is a chaotic co-op party shooter for up to four people. You play as a team, fighting your way through randomly generated rooms filled with various types of enemies, picking up insane magitech guns on the way. Shooting stuff up is simple and hilarious, but only the best of teams can make it all the way back to the evil they've created.\n\nFIVE-SECOND LEARNING CURVE\nAlmost anyone can play NoReload Heroes, from the casual player to the seasoned gamer. No matter how many times someone dies, they can always be revived, as long as at least one of you stays alive. On the higher levels, it will not be so easy... Still, you only use a couple of buttons, and best of all, no need to reload! Simple but intense, laugh-out-loud fun.\n\nUNIQUE GAMEPLAY SESSIONS\nRandomly generated levels, 70+ unique magitech weapons, 43 enemy types and 3 bosses will give you a different gameplay experience every time. There's no way you could meet every enemy type during one session, we've made sure of that. Can you ascend through the maze-like construction to defeat the evil AI you have created? Work as a team to stay alive, or itâ€™s back to the bottom floor with you!\n\nDIFFERENT WAYS TO PLAY\nSqueeze onto a couch with your buddies. If someone's late, they can use hot join to jump in at any point. NoReload Heroes is paced for conversation and designed for social situations, like parties and game nights. We want people to be happy together!",
