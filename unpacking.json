  "description": "Unpacking is a zen game about the familiar experience of pulling possessions out of boxes and fitting them into a new home. Part block-fitting puzzle, part home decoration, you are invited to create a satisfying living space while learning clues about the life you’re unpacking. Over the course of eight house moves, you are given a chance to experience a sense of intimacy with a character you never see and a story you’re never told.\n\nFeatures:\n- Unpack a home — from a single bedroom to an entire house\n- Meditative gameplay with no timers, meters or scores\n- Explore domestic environments with all their nooks and crannies while you stack plates, hang towels, and arrange bookshelves\n- Discover a character's story through the items that come with her to each new home (and the items that get left behind)\n- Soundtrack by BAFTA award-winning composer and audio director Jeff van Dyck",
