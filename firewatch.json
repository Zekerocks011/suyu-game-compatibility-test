  "name": "Firewatch",
  "description": "The year is 1989. You are a man named Henry who has retreated from your messy life to work as a fire lookout in the Wyoming wilderness. Perched high atop a mountain, it’s your job to look for smoke and keep the wilderness safe. An especially hot, dry summer has everyone on edge. Your supervisor, a woman named Delilah, is available to you at all times over a small, handheld radio—your only contact with the world you've left behind. But when something strange draws you out of your lookout tower and into the world, you’ll explore a wild and unknown environment, facing questions and making choices that can build or destroy the only meaningful relationship you have.\n\nIncludes\n• A stunningly beautiful wilderness environment that expands as you explore. \n• A tailor-made story: the choices you make shape the narrative and build relationships. \n• An edge-of-your-seat mystery. \n• Secrets and discoveries to be made over every hill.",
