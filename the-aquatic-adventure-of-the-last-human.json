  "description": "Explore the ruins of humanity in this mesmerising underwater action-adventure. Discover thriving wildlife, encounter monstrous beasts, and let curiosity guide you through an inevitable voyage of extinction.\n\nThe water rose by an unpredictable amount due to climate change. The Earth's surface froze over, and humans were forced to live underwater, where they could still harvest energy and grow food. \n\nAs resources began to dwindle in the year 2971, sub-aquatic spaceships were sent to a nearby wormhole to look for habitable planets. Things did not go as planned. And now the ship Argo9 has returned, thousands of years later… \nMelancholic atmosphere: Witness the beauty of the sea as well as humanity’s influence on nature\nExploratory storytelling: Told through the art and backgrounds with some textual hints along the way\nUnique conflict encounters: Confront – and learn how to overcome – deadly sea creatures \nPolarized gameplay: It's pretty chill until you've gotta fight for your life!\n",
