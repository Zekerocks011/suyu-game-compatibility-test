Using innovative controls, you’ll zap down foes with your Vitamin Beam, brandish the ship's handy claw module, and twist and turn through colorful, maze-like environments to save the members of the Sable family — including the dog! — from an assortment of hazardous and increasingly wacky predicaments. Every stage also features variety-packed sub-games that will have you tilting, grabbing, and dancing your way to victory!\n\nWhen playing together, coordination is key, as one player holds the Joy-Con™ controller vertically to move and shoot, and the other holds the Joy-Con horizontally to rotate and aim.
