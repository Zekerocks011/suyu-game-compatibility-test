  "description": "TowerFall is the ultimate version of the beloved archery combat/party game, featuring all of the content from Ascension and Dark World, and several Nintendo Switch™-exclusive additions!\n\nInspired by classics from the golden age of couch multiplayer, TowerFall centers around hilarious, intense versus matches - best played against friends, sitting cross-legged on the floor within punching distance of each other.\n\nThe core mechanics are simple and accessible, but hard to master, with a huge amount of gameplay variants, arrow types, power-ups, and levels. And when you need a break from the competition, team up in 1-4 player co-op modes, where you’ll fight off a wide variety of monsters, enemy archers, and bosses. \n\nThe Nintendo Switch™ version includes several new and exclusive features, including 6-player battles utilizing widescreen levels, new gameplay variants, and guest archers Madeline and her reflection Badeline from fan-favorite platformer Celeste!",
