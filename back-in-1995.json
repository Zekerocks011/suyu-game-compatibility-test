  "description": "A throwback to the survival horror and mystery games of the mid-90's 32-bit generation, Back in 1995 faithfully re-creates everything from this all-but-forgotten era of games.\n\nBe transported to a world both concrete and indistinct, where you must uncover the mystery surrounding the disappearance of your daughter, the catastrophe that shook the city, and why youâ€™ve decided to finally return.\n\n\nFeatures:\n* Get lost in the nostalgic world of retro 3D graphics, including low-res models, texture warping, CRT emulation, and fixed CCTV style camera angles.\n* Relive the mystery game genre with an old-school user interface and tank controls.\n* Explore a sparse cityscape in the year 1995, littered with clues about the past.\n* Interact with a cast of damaged characters whose intentions you can never truly know.\n* Uncover the mystery of yourself, your daughter, and what happened to the city.\n\n",
