Though once best friends, they have now become your worst nightmare!\n\n \n\nYour Toy is a 3D first person horror room escape game that features an advanced non-repeat puzzle system with challenging riddles, heart-pounding escape sequences and a mysterious narrative that dives deep into your darkest subconsciousness.

Are you ready to enter your nightmares? \n\n \n\nWaking up in darkness, you find yourself trapped in a place long forgotten.

Caught between your own memory and a false dream, a forgotten victim returns, but now play-time is reversed. Who is the toy now?",
