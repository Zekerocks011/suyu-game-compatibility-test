  "description": "Fe is a new type of platform adventure where the story is up to you to discover, without handholding, told wordlessly through the discoveries you make during gameplay.\n\nRun, climb and glide your way through a dark Nordic forest and explore its living, breathing ecosystem filled with secrets and mystical creatures.\n\nAt the heart of the experience is a tactile, analogue song mechanic that allows you to communicate and speak to every living thing in the forest.\n\nLearn a diverse array of animal cries that allow you to befriend or manipulate any creature - even plants. Have birds guide you, bears fight for you and have plants grow berries that help you overcome the Silent Ones.\n\nBecome Fe and discover a world that you will never want to leave.",
