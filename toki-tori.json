  "description": "Take control of Toki Tori, a surprisingly heroic chicken, as he puzzles his way through 80+ levels spread over 5 unique worlds.\n\nToki Tori isn’t very athletic, he can’t even jump! Luckily he has some great tools at his disposal, including the Telewarp, Freeze-o-Matic and InstantRock™.\n\nCreative thinking and problem solving are required to collect all eggs in each level, but don’t worry! When you get stuck, you can always rewind the time. And if all else fails, use the Wildcard to skip a level.\n\nToki Tori for Switch is the most detailed portable version of the game so far. And at this price, why wouldn’t you give it a go?\n\nClassic egg-collecting puzzle platformer\n80+ levels, 5 worlds, dozens of hours of gameplay\nA wide variety of puzzle-solving items and weapons\nNever get stuck: rewind the time or skip a level\nSuper smooth graphics at 60 fps\nHD Rumble support\nVideo capture support",
