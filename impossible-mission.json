You have just 6 hours to find all the pieces to solve a mad scientist’s puzzle while avoiding devious human-seeking robots and deadly black orbs. Includes three versions, the C64 original classic , a re-skinned classic and the totally updated new version.\n\nThe object of the secret mission is to put a stop to the evil genius, Professor Elvin Atombender, who is suspected of hacking into National Security computers. You must penetrate Atombender’s Secret Island bunker. In a race against time, you must search for pieces of a secret password that will shut down the deadly missiles of the deranged Professor. \n\nUsing the elevator system, make your way through the maze of corridors of the secret hideaway, but beware, you will have to outwit the hordes of deadly robots that patrol each area.\n\nThe robots all react in different ways, so observe each robot in turn and try and learn its patrol parameters and attack methods.\n\nOnce into a safe area, check all objects, furniture and computer terminals for pieces of the Secret Password. \n\nIf you fail to find the Password, life on Earth as we know it will change forever...Atombender has Nuclear missiles pointed at strategic targets around the globe...The count down has begun...you have a matter of hours to save the planet...you have been chosen to undertake the Impossible Mission!\n\n\"…another visitor, stay a while, stay forever.\"",
